  <h1>Basics of HTML</h1>
  <b>Basic of the Web</b><br>

<em>Basic components comprising the web are: HTML, URLS, HTTP and Web Apps.</em><br>
<p>HTML is a hypertext markup language and is the main type of document on the web.  
Types of files found on web include; plain text, images, videos and music. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b><br>
<em>HTML is made up of tags and elements.</em> <br>
<p>There are several types of tags, the most important thing to remember about different types of tags
is that they do not have to be remembered! <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> is your friend for finding a tag 
that you have forgotten.  Elements usually have an opening and closing tag, however some tags do not require
a closing tag.  A tag that does not need a closing tag is called a void tag.  A couple of examples of void tags
  are the image tag, &ltimg&gt, and the break tag &ltbr&gt.  I just used <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> to figure out
  how to show tags in text 
  ;)!  Multiple tags can be nested.</p>
 <em>White Space</em> <br>
  <br>
  White space can be achieved using the &ltbr&gt and &ltp&gt tags.  The &ltbr&gt is an inline tag and needs no closing
  tag. The &ltp&gt tag is a block tag and requires closing tag &lt/p&gt.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Key point</b><br>
  <em>Computers are stupid</em><br>
  <p>Computers will do exactly what I tell them to do, as long as I am speaking their language!
    While learning to code may not be as much fun as learning Italian, it will be much more useful for the 
    long haul.
